# TD Combo Metatrader 4

This code is a sample implementation of the TD Combo Buy Countdown strategy in MQL5. It identifies specific market conditions and executes the necessary trade functions when the requirements for the TD Combo Buy Countdown are fulfilled.

## How it works

The code works by looping through the price bars and checking for specific conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. Initialize variables: The code initializes variables for the countdown day, countdownClose, countdownLow, prevClose, and prevLow.

2. Loop through the price bars: The code loops through the price bars and performs the following actions for each bar.

3. Calculate values: The code calculates the countdown day's close, low, and the previous trading day's close and low.

4. Check requirements: The code checks if the requirements for the TD Combo Buy Countdown are fulfilled. It checks if the countdownClose is less than or equal to the low of two bars ago, if the countdownLow is less than the previous low, and if the countdownClose is less than the previous close.

5. Execute trade functions: If the requirements are met, the code executes the necessary trade functions by calling the `ExecuteTrade()` function.

6. Return: The code returns 0 after the loop is completed.
